               The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
               unsupported parameter value (other than grant type),

               utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the
               client, or is otherwise malformed.

         invalid_client
               Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no
               client authentication included, or unsupported
               authentication method).  The authorization server MAY
               return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate
               which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the
               client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization"
               request header field, the authorization server MUST
               respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and
               include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field
               matching the authentication scheme used by the client.

         invalid_grant
               The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization
               code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is
               invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection
               URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to
               another client.

         unauthorized_client
               The authenticated client is not authorized to use this
               authorization grant type.

         unsupported_grant_type
               The authorization grant type is not supported by the
               authorization server.

         invalid_scope
               The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or
               exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.

         Values for the "error" parameter MUST NOT include characters
